<b>Goals:</b>
This was one of my first projects with JavaScript and I really wanted to focus on simplying my code to efficiently achieve successful results. Before starting this project, I had very minimal experience with functions and toggling elements.

<b>Results:</b>
I was able to keep my code short and create a simple and functional to do list that allows the user to enter tasks, cross out and clear completed items, and clear the entire list. I also made the website responsive including on mobile devices.
