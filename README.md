A simple and responsive to do list using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The user can enter tasks, cross out and clear completed items, and clear the entire list.


## What I Learned
How to write code to toggle elements on and off based on user actions using Javascript. I was also able to break down the functionality into smaller, manageable parts and plan out the development process in advance making my work flow very efficient.
